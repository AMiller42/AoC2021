# AoC2021
These are my solutions for Advent of Code 2021. This is the first year that I am participating in AoC, and my goal is to complete every challenge using [Vyxal](https://github.com/Vyxal/Vyxal), a golfing language created by [Lyxal](https://github.com/Lyxal).

<!-- Never gonna give you up
     Never gonna let you down
     Never gonna run around and desert you
     Never gonna make you cry
     Never gonna say goodbye
     Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you -->
